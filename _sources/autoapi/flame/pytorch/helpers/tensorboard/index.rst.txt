   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter`

   Writes entries directly to event files in the log_dir to be
   consumed by TensorBoard.

   The `SummaryWriter` class provides a high-level API to create an event file
   in a given directory and add summaries and events to it. The class updates the
   file contents asynchronously. This allows a training program to call methods
   to add data to the file directly from the training loop, without slowing down
   training.
